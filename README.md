# EasyType

This plugin is designed to assist me in writing LaTeX with Chinese input method.
I found it really annoying to switch input methods whenever I want to type LaTeX commands.

This plugin automatically converts consecutive "、、" into "\", which eliminates the need to switch between Chinese and English input methods. 

I may consider adding more characters in the future, but for now, my priority is to finish my thesis first :P
